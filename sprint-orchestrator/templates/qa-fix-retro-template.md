## KB Candidates Review

> **User action required:** For each P0/P1 candidate, choose one decision below. After your decisions, the Sprint Lead invokes `zzem-kb:write-pattern` for each `approved` candidate.

| Candidate File | Ticket | Pri | Title | Type | Decision |
|----------------|--------|-----|-------|------|----------|
| `kb-candidates/ZZEM-123.yaml` | ZZEM-123 | P0 | <title> | pattern_gap | [ ] approve / [ ] reject / [ ] merge-into:<existing-id> |

**Reinforcement alerts** (auto-detected — same pattern violated 3+ times this round):
- `<existing-pattern-id>`: violated in tickets <T1>, <T2>, <T3> → consider revising the pattern's `detection` or `prevention`.

**Volume gate:** If approved count > 5, user is asked to pick top-N before merge.

## Deferred Index

For next-round planning.

| Ticket | Pri | Summary | Defer Reason | Next Round Candidate |
|--------|-----|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| ZZEM-456 | P3 | <summary> | <reason> | yes/no |

## Unresolved

Tickets that exhausted fix loop (2 rounds) without PASS. Jira not transitioned. Human intervention required.

| Ticket | Pri | Summary | Last Evaluator Verdict | Suggested Next Action |
|--------|-----|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| ZZEM-789 | P1 | <summary> | <verdict summary> | <reassignment / scope-cut / external dep> |

## Next Round Suggestion

Generated JQL for the next QA-Fix round (deferred + new since this snapshot).

```
project = ZZEM AND (key in (<deferred keys>) OR (created > "<this snapshot_at>" AND priority in (P0, P1)))
```
